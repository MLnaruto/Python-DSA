1. Need of DSA
2. Algorithm: a step by step process to solve a problem
3. Data structures
4. Data types
    .Basic
    .complex

    .Basic Data type:
     --> Numeric: int, float, complex --> 10, 9.56, 3+2j
     --> Boolean
     --> sequence: string,range,list,tuple


wer are given some problem ( a maths problem)
- understand the logic 
- convert this logic to code
- give this code to the system
- the code will get processed
- we get the output


algorithm need to be converted to systems language

variable , x = 9 
print(x)
output : 9
if you want the algorithm to be working very efficiently, then the data should be in a structured
format, 

python, java, etc

x = 10 ---> integer 
a = 2.56 ---> float
c = "Ram" --> string (a collection of characters) 'Ram' or "Ram"
d = 2+3j --> integer + imaginary number --- "complex"


bank balance = 200000
temperature = -10c extreme cold
temp = 50c extreme hot
temp = 0c neutral in position 


sequence data type: order 1,2,3,4,5 etc 8,7,6,5,4, etc
1. used to store multiple values in a single variable in an organized and efficient way.
2. ex: strings, range, list, tuple


string:
1. a sequence of characters represented in a single or double quotes
   Ex: "ML Naruto" or 'ML Naruto'

2. + operator: it concatenates two or more strings together by joining them. Team India
3. * operator: it is a representation of multiplication 
4. it's immutable means ( we can't change the value") Team seam


Range:
1. a sequence of numbers
2. used in for, while loops
3. it's immutable in nature
4. syntax: range(start,stop,step)
    start --> to start anything
    stop --> to prevent anything (it's exclusive that means it wont be including in our output)
    step --> the difference between the start and the stop

2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,22

20,19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,10
20,18,16,14,12


Lists:
1. used to store multiple items in a single variable
2. duplicate values are allowed inside a list
3. we can have different types of data inside the list
4. it's muttable in nature
5. ordered 
6. dynamic
7. can use some operators with lists --> in, not in, +, *
8. can use len(),min(),max()

'Naruto' is the string
25 is the int
500000 is the int
6.2 is the float
'Naruto',25,50000,6.2
0        1   2     3

1,5,6,9,8,3,200
0,1,2,3,4,5,6
list1[1:6]

Tuple:
1. used to store multiple items in a single variable
2. data is ordered
3. it's immutable 
4. duplicate values are allowed
5. tuples are the replacement for the lists if we wish to store the data that should not be
   changed.
6. we can use some operators with tuples --> +,*, membership, iteration 
7. can use few built in functions with tuples --> len(), min(), max(), etc
8. we can also use tuples in for loop.
syntax: (1,2,"Naruto",56)
