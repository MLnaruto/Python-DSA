Operators:
1.Membership operators : in, not in
2.Identity operators  : is, is not
3.Logical operators : AND, OR, NOT
4.Equality operator: ==

Datatypes:
1. complex : dict, sets, frozenset




1.Membership operators:
python. int, float, bool, sequence(list,tuple,range,string)
1 group (singles): 
   condition : this is only for singles no committed people are allowed.
   test: 

1. we want to check whether a number or something belongs to a specific group or not
2. in and not in


(2,4,6,8,10 ) ---> even numbers


1,9,8,6,2,3
1= odd number -- rejected
9 = odd number -- rejected
8 = even number -- allowed

Identity operators:
  
1. just comparing the objects
2. is , is not 
3. we just want to know whether the two variables are actually refering to the same object or not.
4. == equality operator

ex: 1. 2 babies are twins with the names Ram, Bheem
       == operator is nothing but comparing all the physical characteristics of the twins (ram, bheem)
        whether ram has the same face as of bheem or not ? --> == equality operator
        whether ram has the same apple watch as of bheem or not ? --> == equality operator

       ram is not bheem.
       ram is a person
       bheem is another person.



Logical operators:
1. they are used to combine multiple conditions. 
2. AND, OR, NOT


ex:  aptitude test ------------- stage 1
     technical round ------------ stage 2
     

     hr round -------------------- final stage
  
     AND operator (logical operator)


     
     exhibition: he just paid some 50 rupees at the counter, then he was given 2 balls.  now the goal is to throw these 2 balls 
                 on some times one after the other. 
                 output: he will only win, if he throws either of the 2 balls on a particular item 


complex data type:
1. Dictionaries:
   --> it's a collection of different data types that is stored in a single variable.
   --> it's a combination of key and value pairs
   --> the keys must be immutable, and hashable but the value(data) is mutable 
   --> the data is stored in unordered way
   --> it is used to map the data or to trace out the data with the help of the keys.
   --> here keys are case sensitive, and the keys should be unique in nature, they can't be duplicated

   a= { '1': 'Name',
        '2': 'Age',
        '3': 'Salary'}

here '1' ----> key
     'Name' -----> value

2. set:
   ---> collection of different data types
   --->  the data is unordered
   ---> it's mutable, unhashable
   ---> it doesn't have any duplicated values inside it 
   ---> we can use set with some operators, and with some built in functions 
        ex: in, not in, len(), max(), min(), etc
   ---> a set() returns a set object from an iterable


3. Immutable sets or frozen sets:
    ---> it's immutable (can't change once it's assigned)
    ---> it has data in unordered way
    ---> we use frozenset when we want to use a set, but we also need the immutable object

a = {'java', python, rbu, scala}
print(a)
output: rbu, scala, java, python
