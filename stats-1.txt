STATISTICS: 
    --> definition: These are the methods to 
                     explain, 
                     understand, and 
                     interpret 
                     the data which is affected to great extend by several causes
    
    --> practical example
        ex: data about the covid 19 patients: this data is impacted by several factors
                    --> person without a vaccination
                    --> person without a face mask
                    --> person without social distancing

             there are 222569 covid cases in asia or the covid cases in asia are damn high
             the temperatures in asia have gone to some 52 degrees celsius

data : quantitative and qualitative

        numbers           categories
        ex: age(165cm,
               170cm)            ex: gender(male,female,other)

business analytics: 
   --> definition : it's the broad usage of the data and quantitative analysis for both quantitative and qualitative data 
                    for decision making.

   --> practical example :  i have a data of employees in it sector (data may be either quantitative or qualitative)
                            --> i need to perform some quantitative analysis on this data
                            --> we can draw some business conclusions from the analysis
                            --> we can finally take some business decisions based on that conclusions.


Relation between statistics and business anlaytics: 
             statistics is the heart of business analytics.
   

why statistics is so crucial in today's world of data: 
                          
                1. earlier we have the data in only one or two forms (ex: either in written format (i.e., letters, envelopes, postcards etc) 
                2. data is now getting generated from wide range of resources (ex: videos, images, audio clips, papers, in electronic gadgets) and it is 
                   generated in huge amounts.
                  ex: number of people who are googling in a given point of time. 

                   

 a) in analytics, we have two kinds of analytics:

1. i have a set of goals, and i gather data to find out at what extent our goals are met. so i go to each and every
   people and perform some survey(online or offline) & collect the opinions (nothing but the data) and we analyze and 
   we interpret the data and then we get some conclusions. Based on those conclusions, we will make a business report or
   we will take business decisions.

2. i don't have any goals. i just observe the data and finds out the patterns and trends involved in it. companies 
   make use of these patterns , trends and gain profits from them or they can improve their performance based on those 
   patterns or trends.


b) computer power >>>>>>>> 
   we can process and analyze the big data also. 
   bcz we have faster algorithms to solve problems. 
   also we can vizualize the data for business intelligence


c) storage capacity>>>>>>>> 
   we can do parallel computing , cloud computing with much better computer softwares and hardwares, 
   due to which we can solve any problem in today's world much faster.

  --> storage capacity is directly proportionaly to capacity of performing statistical analysis
